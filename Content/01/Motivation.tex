With the rapid development and popularization of internet and technology, the traditional educational activities are moving to the online platforms.

A discussion of the teaching content or the educational material is always essential for both tutors and students in the teaching activities. However, the traditional approach of discussing shows its limitations. Not all the students have the same question and the tutor is able to offer explanation for only one question at same time. Moreover, a discussion can only be performed normally after courses also requires the absence of the students as well as the tutor.

Therefore, a discuss system with intense interactivity as well as in crowdsourcing way is highly needed. To achieve high interactivity, a discuss system with graphical tool and real-time data communication is proposed. Students are able to contribute their questions and answers to get to the bottom of his deficiencies of teaching content and the educational material. In addition, students who has the same questions are able to  acquire the best solution instantly which is recommended and approved by the community.
